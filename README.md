# hello-world
This is  my first repository for notes, ideas, etc.


This is a review of web design and development concepts previously learned.

I completed a resonsive Design Class at FreeCodeCamp. It was a 300 Hour online class and it solidified much of what I learned previously.
I have committed to an online class which is more of what I need to keep moving forward.

Covid-19 shutdown in NYC caused an unexpected break, My interent provider was adequate prior to the shutdown. the added traffic from online schools, work at home employees and stay home shoppers overwhelmed the internet provider. There was much downtime, now all is well.
